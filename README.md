# Multivariable-Regression

This repository contains data from the function $y = 4x_{2}^{2}x1+2x_{2}^{2}+3x_{1}+1$. The data is stored in a NumPy .npz file called data.npz. The .npz file contains two arrays: X and y. The X array contains the input features, and the y array contains the output values.
In this assignment we used 3 regression models and tried to estimate this function:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression with degree of 3
- Polynomial Regression with degree of 5
